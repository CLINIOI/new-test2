    Sometimes Xpiks is not correctly scaled on Windows because both Xpiks and Windows use different interface scaling techniques. Open <strong>Windows settings</strong>, section Display and look for <strong>Change the size of apps and text on main display</strong>. The dropdown will contain 100%, 125% and so on. To fix the problem select 100% or 200% value, open Xpiks and you will be able to pass the license window. You can revert Windows setting back after this.
