    I have been using Xpiks for over two years as part of my video and photo stock metadata purposes. I've bought a copy for a few of my employees and everybody has learned to use it very easily. Xpiks helped streamline my microstock creation and we as a team became much more efficient.

    This app is easy to use, it's simple but at the same time, it has so many great features, which helps me to save a tone of time on keywording. My favorite feature is the color tag filter - I can customize my filtering process based on my needs. Also, I love a library with keywords, where I'm saving my prewritten keywords and I can categorize them as well - very useful.

    The metadata feature of Xpiks is better than any other software of its class. It is easy to use. Xpiks is essential for anyone creating stock photography or needing to categorize their imagery.

    First and most important thing is, Xpiks exist! This industry needs this type of software and I can honestly say Xpiks best of it. Here is why; Alternative softwares (I tried all of it), is really complicated. For beginners (I was a beginner at the beginning too) could be very difficult to understand what function will do. But Xpiks is very clean and it has a good interface. Also, I'm a UI and UX designer and I can say, they did most of the things correctly.

    The ease of use and the various functionalities about keywording and sending pics to microstock agencies is the best feature of Xpiks, I didn't tried yet the plugins to add more options but they seem very useful to run faster the workflow. Great software.

    Love the fact that I no longer have to copy and paste all keywords throughout different websites such as Shutterstock, Pond5, Adobe Stock, etc. I can simply keyword, title, & describe all of my photos and videos, and simply upload them to each corresponding website!
