Xpiks has a convenience function that allows you to automatically select similar images from keywords suggestion. You can right-click the suggested image and select _"Select similar"_. This function works best when performing [reverse image search]({{< relref "/tutorials/suggestion-reverse-search.md" >}}).

### Images similar to current

When using keywords suggestion during editing a single image (in [single editing view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-single-view" >}}) or [main view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-mainview" >}})), you can also select similar images to that image. If such selection is possible, you will see a _"Select similar"_ button.
