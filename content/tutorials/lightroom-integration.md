### RAW files support

Xpiks supports all types of "RAW" files starting with version 1.7.3. You can add, edit, save and upload files like `CR2`, `CR3`, `CRW`, `RAF`, `NEF`, `NRW`, `DNG`, `RW2`, `SRW`, `ARW`, `SRF`, `SR2`, `ORF`. Please note that you need Xpiks Pro license in order to add these files.

### Using Xpiks with Lightroom

While there're no additional plugins that you need to install, you can use Xpiks with Lightroom _transparently_ and _interchangeably_. For example, you can first open your file in Xpiks and use Xpiks capabilities to add Keywords, Title and Description to a photo.

![Edit metadata in Xpiks](/images/tutorials/integrations/xpiks-metadata.JPG "Editing metadata in Xpiks")

After that you can [save]({{< relref "/tutorials/intro-saving.md" >}}) your changes and open the same file in Lightroom. Now it will have your edits:

> Note: you need to save your file in Xpiks **before** you import it to Lightroom

![Consume metadata in Lightroom](/images/tutorials/integrations/lightroom-metadata.jpg "Consuming metadata in Lightroom")

After this you may continue processing RAW files in Lightroom and/or export them to print-on-demand services etc.
