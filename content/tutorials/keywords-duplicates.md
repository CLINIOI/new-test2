Some microstocks consider semantical duplicates as a spam. So it might be not favorable to have nouns in singular and plural form as keywords to the same artwork (e.g. having "tooth" and "teeth").

If duplicates detection is turned on in Settings, Xpiks will highlight duplicates with blue in _Keywords_ field and in _Description_ and _Title_ as well.

In order to fix them Xpiks highlights them clearly for you if you click "Show duplicates".
