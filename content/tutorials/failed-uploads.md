Sometimes you will fail to upload your artworks to microstock websites. This can happen for various reasons - see [Upload troubleshooting]({{< relref "/tutorials/uploading-troubleshoot" >}}) for details. When this happens, Xpiks shows a red upload progress and you can see how many files failed to upload in the lower left corner.

Keep in mind that before showing upload as "failed", **Xpiks retries upload at least 3 times for each file** without your intervention. If you want to retry the whole upload again, you can click "Retry failed" button that will try to reupload all failed files again.
