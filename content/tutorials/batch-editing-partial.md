Sometimes you want only to:

* set same _Title_ to multiple artworks at once
* clear _Description_ in multiple artworks at once
* add few _Keywords_ to multiple artworks at once
* append few words to few descriptions at once

You can do all of that and even more in the [batch editing view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-multiple-view" >}}). It contains checkboxes next to each field like _Title_, _Description_ or _Keywords_ that allow to include or exclude changes done in these field when you will press "Save". In the checkbox dropdown you can find advanced options like if only to append text or keywords.

For example, if you uncheck the checkbox next to _Title_, when you will press "Save" changes that you made to _Title_ field will not be applied to artworks you are editing. Here's how to add _"Generative AI"_ using partial changes:

Of course **you can mix those**: you can turn off everything but _Title_ or _Keywords_ etc.
