Usually when you batch-edit artworks and apply changes, you overwrite previous metadata in artworks with what you entered in [batch edit view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-multiple-view" >}}).

Sometimes though you want **just to append few keywords to a bunch of artworks**. In Xpiks it could be done with "Only append new keywords" checkbox in batch edit view.

![Append keywords](/images/tutorials/batch-editing/append-keywords.png)

With this option ON, Xpiks will _not_ overwrite keywords but for each artwork will add keywords that you typed in _Keywords_ field.

If you will turn this option OFF, the result would be quite different:

![Append keywords off](/images/tutorials/batch-editing/append-keywords-off.gif)

As you can see, Xpiks just overwrites keywords in each artwork selected for batch editing.
