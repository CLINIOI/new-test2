> As of early 2022 Xpiks also provides "Translator 2.0" as a [plugin]({{< relref "/plugins/translator-plugin.md" >}}) that automatically translates to and from 26 languages. In the plugin you do not need to find offline dictionaries.

Translator tab in Xpiks allows you to translate single words offline using [StarDict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarDict) dictionaries.

Because of the legal reasons Xpiks doesn't ship with any dictionaries preinstalled. You can easily find dictionaries online or use your own purchased dictionaries. Press "Add dictionary" in the dropdown to add local dictionaries. Afterwards just enter the word into the active input to translate it.

If the translation does not fit you can see all of it using "Show more" link.
