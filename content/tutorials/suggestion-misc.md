## Managing suggested keywords

Xpiks splits keywords from selected suggestions into _"suggested"_ keywords and _"other"_. You might want to look through them and remove some "suggested" keywords and add some "other" keywords. You can achieve that by clicking on the "cross" icon or clicking on the keyword while holding `Ctrl` button (`Cmd` on macOS).

And also you can move all of the suggested keywords to "Other" section and add them one by one. To do that you need to use "Clear" action in the context menu.

You can repeat suggestion and add keywords many times from this dialog without closing it.

## Local files suggestion

Xpiks indexes all files you ever opened and it allows searching through them as you would search using microstocks websites. Just select _"Local files"_ in dropdown on the right and you don't need internet to use _"Suggest keywords"_ anymore.

## Advanced actions

You can also open suggested image in browser from the context menu as well as copy available metadata to [QuickBuffer]({{< relref "/tutorials/quickbuffer-overview" >}}). It could be useful in case you want to take a look at other image properties like Description/Title, Author, location or anything else provided on the microstock website and not available in Xpiks.
