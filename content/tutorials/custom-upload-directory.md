In general Xpiks automatically uploads images, vectors and videos into the appropriate directories at each supported microstock.

However, sometimes it is required to upload files to a custom directory that is not selected in Xpiks automatically. For example, Xpiks did not support editorial statuses for some time and Xpiks couldn't automatically upload to "editorial" directories of certain microstocks.

Now it is possible by selecting any directory manually.
