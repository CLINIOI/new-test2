Sometimes agencies are using different username/password for FTP access than they use for website login. Luckily, you need to set them up only once. This page contains instructions on how exactly to get them.

## Adobe Stock

> NOTE: Your account needs to be "qualified" to upload via SFTP, otherwise only web upload is available. See **step 3** for details.

To closely follow the process, make sure you use English version of Adobe Stock portal. You can also check the [official guide from Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/uploading-content.html).

**Step 1. Login to Adobe Stock portal**

Open [Adobe Stock Portal](https://stock.adobe.com) and click "Sell" to take you to the contributor login.

**Step 3. Click "Learn more" link**

> If you do **not** see the "Learn more" link, it means your account does not qualify for FTP upload in Adobe Stock. Please contact Adobe Stock support to find out why.

You will see instructions for uploading. Click "Learn more" link, which is next to the text "You can also import files using your SFTP".
