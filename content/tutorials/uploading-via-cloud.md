> Please note that Cloud Upload is available only if you have **Pro+** license (ordinary _Pro_ license does not have this feature).

As of Xpiks 1.7.1 you can also delegate upload of your files to Xpiks Cloud. This means that you would effectively upload only once from your computer to the Cloud and then we upload your files to the agencies FTP servers. This allows you to save a lot of time and have a piece of mind. Xpiks Cloud has a reliable internet connectivity and will also retry uploads automatically.

To start Cloud Upload, simply tick the checkbox in the upload dialog:
