Once you're ready to [upload artworks]({{< relref "/tutorials/intro-uploading" >}}) you can proceed to upload dialog.

## FTP hosts

On the left you can see list of FTP stocks where Xpiks can upload to. Initially stocks list is empty and you should add some hosts on your own.

## FTP settings

_Title_ field is just for your convenience: it's what will be displayed in the column on the left. Other fields are required FTP credentials (host, username and password) that you need to fill in order to upload files anywhere. Also this panel contains _Advanced_ settings which are rarely needed to tweak.

Xpiks saves your credentials in secure manner and also allows you to set master password.

## Xpiks Cloud

You can read more about cloud upload on the [main page]({{< relref "/pages/cloud-upload.md" >}}). If cloud upload checkbox is *disabled* then most probably [total upload size]({{< relref "/pages/cloud-upload.md#total-upload-size" >}}) is too small.
