Sometimes you accidentally add keywords to several artworks at once and forget to press "Undo" link. Fortunately Xpiks has a convenient way to delete odd keywords. Just select artworks which you want to clean up and find _"Delete keywords"_ in menus for selected artworks either from [main actions]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-mainview" >}}) or from menu _Edit -> Selected artworks_.

Just like in the other similar views, you can add keywords using `Ctrl + click` (`Cmd` on macOS).
