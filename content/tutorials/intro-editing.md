You can fill in _Title_, _Description_ and _Keywords_ for each artwork in Xpiks. There're are several ways to do it:

## In the main window

Files initially are opened in the [main window]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-mainview" >}}) of the program. You can do all the edits right there:

## In the single editing view

You can open one file in the [single artwork editing view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-single-view" >}}). Just double-click the image or use artwork's context menu:

## In the batch editing view

Also sometimes it's handy to edit multiple similar images at once. To do that you need select images you want to edit and press "Edit" toolbar button. You will see [batch editing view]({{< relref "/tutorials/interface-multiple-view" >}}):
