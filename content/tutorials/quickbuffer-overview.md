## General

QuickBuffer is an advanced clipboard in Xpiks. You can copy, paste and edit structured metadata from and to artworks or different [editing views]({{< relref "/tutorials/intro-editing" >}}).

Most simple usage can be shown below. You can just fill in [metadata]({{< relref "/blog/2020/metadata" >}}) and paste it to different artworks. In order to paste from QuickBuffer, place where you paste it should be "active" (e.g. contain cursor).

But manual entry is not only what you would expect to do with clipboard. So you can copy to QuickBuffer from different places like context menus or buttons.

### Applying metadata to multiple artworks

Starting with Xpiks 1.7.2 you can also apply to multiple artworks at the same time:

However note, that [Batch Editing View]({{< relref "/tutorials/batch-editing-basic.md" >}}) is a preferred way to do such edits.
