In order to add [metadata]({{< relref "/blog/2020/metadata" >}}) to your artworks you need first to open them in Xpiks.

Most simple way to do that is to drag'n'drop them from outside. Xpiks will prompt you a dialog to import metadata which is already stored in files.

Also you can click **Add files** or **Add directories** buttons and select files or directories separately.

Users, who [upload vector files]({{< relref "/blog/2020/upload-vectors-shutterstock" >}}), could also add a pair of vector + preview. But if you only add preview, Xpiks will find vector automatically. Please note, that your files should have the same name e.g. **Flower.eps** and **Flower.jpg**.
