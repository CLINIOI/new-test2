## About presets

A Preset is just a set of keywords with a unique name. You can create these sets via _Edit -> Presets_ menu.

As you can see on the picture above, it's dead simple. Preset "Mountains" has 9 keywords and it belongs to the group "Nature". That's all.

### Temporary presets

Preset can be marked as temporary - that is available only during current session in Xpiks. It can be useful if you're working with a very specific files that presets are useful for, but you'd prefer to automatically cleanup presets.

## Creating presets

### From the presets dialog

To create preset you just click "Add new" and fill in what is needed:

And what you can do with preset is to [insert]({{< relref "/tutorials/presets-inserting.md" >}}) it into keywords in a number of ways.

### From artwork's keywords

You can create preset directly using some file's keywords. You can find _"Create a preset"_ in the context menu for keywords.

## Sorting presets

You can keep presets in the menu sorted by changing a Setting in the UI section. Note presets on the left are sorted while presets on the right have the same order as when created.
