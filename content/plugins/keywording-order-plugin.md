## Overview

It is not uncommon to hire other people to keyword your photos, vectors or videos. Using this plugin you can easily create a single file that you can share with the freelancer and later import back to Xpiks. 

## Security

Sharing your photos, vectors or videos with other people is not secure in general. Other person's computer might be compromised or some 3rd party might have unauthorized access to it. In the end your files might get published online for free or, worse, being sold on microstocks by others.

This plugin eliminates such possibility by creating a secure container that can be edited in Xpiks. Even if 3rd party accesses your files, they will be downscaled and watermarked, which will make them unusable for other people.

## How does it work

Keywording with this plugin usually consists of 3 steps:

1. Owner of the files creates a keywording order file and sends it
2. Freelancer does the keywording and sends the order file back
3. Owner of the files imports order file back to original files

### Creating the order

Select files you want to get keyworded and select "Export keywording order":

### Opening file in Xpiks

If the Keywording Order plugin is installed, you can open the order file directly in Xpiks:

![Open order](/images/plugins/keywording-order/open-order.gif "Just drag'n'drop the order file to Xpiks")

After that you can do the keywording how you would typically do in Xpiks. When it's done, [save]({{< relref "/tutorials/intro-saving" >}}) files as usual.

### Importing the order back

Finally, to import the order, open original files in Xpiks. After that select _"Plugins" -> "Keywording Order" -> "Import order"_. In the dialog that will appear, select the order file and press _"Import"_. You will have an option to preview changes and selectively apply them.
