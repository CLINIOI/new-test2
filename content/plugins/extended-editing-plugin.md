## Overview

This plugin provides a list of various operations to do with description, title and keywords, such as:

- trimming keywords with a specified number (e.g. _"have 40 keywords maximum"_ for all artworks)
- sorting keywords alphabetically for selected artworks
- trimming title or description (cutting excess characters or words from the whole text or from beginning/ending)
- copying filename to title or description
- copying title and description between each other

All these actions can be used only for the list of selected artworks and are available from the "More" menu.
