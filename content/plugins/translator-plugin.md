## Overview

Translator plugin is an upgrade over [built-in translator]({{< relref "/tutorials/translator-overview.md" >}}) functionality in Xpiks. The difference is that for built-in translator you need to provide your own dictionaries in the StarDict format, while this plugin works with online translation services out of the box.

Plugin supports translation to and from 26 different languages: _Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, English (UK and US), Spanish, Estonian, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Latvian, Dutch, Polish, Portutuese (Brazil and EU), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, Chinese_. Translation rate limits apply.
