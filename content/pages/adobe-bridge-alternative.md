## Why you should consider Xpiks

### What is Adobe Bridge

![](/images/screenshots/Adobe-Bridge-screenshot.jpg "Screenshot of Adobe Bridge (courtesy of www.winnebago.com)")

[Adobe Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Bridge) is the file manager and digital asset management software that is about 20 years old. It is free, it was created by Adobe to accompany it's other software suite (like Photoshop) and it's features are mostly duplicated in Lightroom nowadays. Screenshot above is not the most beautiful screenshot of Bridge, but it does not get much better than that.

## Xpiks advantages

Main Xpiks advantage is that it was created **specifically** for microstock contributors. While Adobe Bridge has some features that **can** be used by microstock contributors (e.g. upload to Adobe Stock, save metadata to photos), it's not the most convenient tool, to put it lightly.

Hence Xpiks has lots and lots of features that would never fly in Adobe Bridge, but are so valued by microstock contributors. Features like [Keywords Suggestion]({{< relref "/tutorials/suggestion-overview.md" >}}), [CSV Import]({{< relref "/tutorials/import-csv.md" >}}) (or Export), [Model release generation]({{< relref "/plugins/model-release-plugin.md" >}}), [metadata translation]({{< relref "/plugins/translator-plugin.md" >}}), [keywording autocompletion]({{< relref "/tutorials/keywords-overview.md" >}}) and many, many others.
