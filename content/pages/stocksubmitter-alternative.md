## Why you should consider Xpiks

### What is Stock Submitter

![](/images/posts/2022/keywording-tools/quick-meta.jpg "Screenshot of Stock Submitter")

StockSubmitter is a Windows-only application founded in Russia in 2011. It works only on Windows and looks somewhat outdated, if to put it lightly. Interface is very cluttered. It does have a free version and it supports majority of microstocks though. One thing where it excels is the automatic submit functionality, however, accordingly to their forums, it suffers intermittent problems quite frequently.

## Xpiks advantages

Main Xpiks advantage comparing to Stock Submitter is that it's easy to use and looks beautiful. Also there're such things as being truly cross-platform and having different advanced features for microstock contributors. But this isn't what everybody will notice, unlike the usability and the looks.

Xpiks has tons of excellent documentation in [tutorials](/tutorials) that can help you going as well as first-class app support. StockSubmitter has been built primarily for Russian community and main support forums, VKontakte and Telegram pages are not available in English.
