Dreamstime, one of the oldest agencies, is still alive! Perhaps this is one of the quite positive things you could ever say about the agency, given the rise and fall of the likes of EyeEm, Veer, StockPhotoMedia etc. Dreamstime has never been the best-selling agency for anybody, but they were steadily sitting in the middle of the ratings for years. Dreamstime as a platform was slowly but surely evolving, adding features and improving the website. It is definitely recommended to have an account there too and in this guide we'll walk you through the essentials of working with them.

### Understanding Dreamstime's licensing

When you upload your content on Dreamstime you might be overwhelmed by amount of choice to make with regards to licensing. Hopefully this chapter will clear some confusion out.

![Licenses](/images/posts/2024/dreamstime/licenses.png "Licensing options when uploading")

Dreamstime offers *Royalty-Free* and *Extended Licenses*. [Royalty-free licenses]({{< relref "/blog/2019/licensing-models.md" >}}) allow unlimited use after purchase, while Extended Licenses offer broader usage rights, potentially leading to higher earnings.

#### Royalty-Free License

In other words, there are no license fees except the initial fee and no other royalties to be paid except those included in the initial cost. You are allowed to use the image for an unlimited number of copies, printed and/or electronic. As an author, you are also allowed to sell the image on other marketplaces.

#### Extended License

There are several types of extended licenses, each with their own advantages.

**Unlimited Seats (U-EL)** - This license grants unlimited usage rights of the purchased media to the entire staff of the organization which purchased it. The number of copies allowed is unlimited for each designer / employee.

**Web Usage (W-EL)** - This license allows the media to be used in online projects that will be resoled / distributed, such as website templates, screensavers, e-cards, etc.

**Print Usage (P-EL)** -  This license is similar to the Web Usage license but for physical media. It allows the purchased media to be used in tangible products for resale/distribution such as t-shirts, calendars, framed artwork, etc.

**Sell the Rights (SR-EL)** - The license grants the media buyer full and exclusive ownership of the media item from that point on. The media will be no longer be made available for sale to other buyers and the creator must disable the media permanently from all other places where they may be selling it.

**Time Limited Exclusivity (SR-EL1, SR-EL3)** - This license also grants the buyer full and exclusive ownership of the media, but only for a limited time, with SR-EL1 granting exclusivity for one year and SR-EL3 granting exclusivity for 3 years. After this time, the media item can again be re-sold to other buyers.

**Universal Extended License** - If a buyer has used media that required an extended license without purchasing the license first, Universal Extended License allows them to obtain permission retroactively for the unlicensed prior use.

## How much you earn on Dreamstime

All contributors on Dreamstime can earn **up to** `50%` (depends on your level) revenue share per sale of non-exclusive media and `60%` revenue share on media sold exclusively on Dreamstime. Level depends on the total amount of sales done in your account and, unlike Shutterstock, it does not reset every year. Exclusive content also earns the contributor an additional `$0.20` bonus for each approved submission. This bonus is awarded for the first `100` approved files in all circumstances and only for the first `10,000` approved files if a contributor’s download rate is higher than `1`.

### Content pricing

The pricing of your content on Dreamstime is influenced by several factors, including the quality of the image, its potential demand, and the chosen licensing type. Dreamstime also operates on a level system, where the more times an image is downloaded, the higher its price goes. This system rewards popular content and encourages sellers to upload high-quality, in-demand images. Additionally, buyers are able to purchase images in one of two ways: individually with [credits](https://www.dreamstime.com/credits), or as part of a recurring subscription. Each of these options results in different earnings for the contributor.

The revenue share you earn is based on the type of media being sold and how many times the item has been previously purchased. This screenshot below shows an example of what an image that has been downloaded 5-9 times before might earn:

Optimizing your submissions is essential to stand out in the content pool on Dreamstime. This means ensuring the highest quality in terms of resolution and composition and paying attention to your content's relevance and uniqueness.
