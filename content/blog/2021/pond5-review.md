It started with generous royalties for authors and has collected 25 million video clips since then. In the recent years they also started selling photos, music, 3D models and sound effects, while keeping same high level of royalties.

Being founded in 2006, it is one of the youngest microstock agencies. And also one of the successful ones: getting 61 million dollars investments in 2014 from Accel Partners and Stripe Group, acquiring photo stock Pixmac and opening new offices around the world Pond5 is prospering.

To make the stock footage more accessible to customers Pond5 team released an add-on for Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. This and huge video library made it a go-to place for everybody who needs video content and thus - a go-to place for creators of those videos too.

## Public domain project

Pond5 also broke videos into individual frames thus creating lots of stills that can be used in social media and on the web.

Our Public Domain Project empowers media makers to take advantage of this incredibly rich library thatâ€™s rightfully theirs."
