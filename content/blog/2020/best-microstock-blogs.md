Staying educated and social is a must for improving your skills and increasing artwork sales. In this post we highlight the most interesting microstock blogs you can find on the internet that will help with that. All blogs in this review are in English and some microstock top-bloggers from Germany, Spain and Ukraine didn't get into the list. With that said, let's get to the blogs themselves.

## Brutally Honest Microstock

[![Brutally honest microstock website](/images/posts/2020/best-microstock-blogs/brutally-honest-microstock.jpg)](https://brutallyhonestmicrostock.com/)

One of the most interesting contributor blogs written by Alex Rotenberg. You can find ideas for your artworks, detailed statistics and microstock websites reviews. Alex blogs quite regularly about areas related to photography and video. Also he publishes monthly earnings reports which is quite transparent (or brutally honest, if you will). Some time ago he wrote a useful [book for newcomers to microstock](https://brutallyhonestmicrostock.com/2017/06/04/new-guide-for-beginners-brutally-honest-guide-to-microstock-photography/) which got positive reviews in community.

If you want to read some post to get a feeling of the blog, we can recommend [September 2020 in review](https://brutallyhonestmicrostock.com/2020/09/30/september-2020-brutally-honest-earnings-report/) or [tips on book cover photography](https://brutallyhonestmicrostock.com/2019/08/06/7-tips-on-getting-started-in-book-cover-photography/).
